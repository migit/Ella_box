Imagine a pocket sized device straight out of a cyberpunk novel: a glowing OLED display, pulsating selector with menus, and tactile feedback that hums with every twist of a rotary encoder. Meet ELLA-Box, a versatile ESP32-C3-based gadget that combines a futuristic interface with practical functionality. Whether you’re controlling smart home devices, monitoring environmental sensors, or crafting a wearable notification badge, this project is your gateway to building a sleek, low-cost IoT device with a cyberpunk feel and look (I am personally tired of touch screens and lifeless apps :P ).
I started this project to explore the ESP32-C3’s potential. A tiny, affordable (€2–3) microcontroller with Wi-Fi and BLE and to create a device that feels like it belongs in a sci-fi universe. The result is a modular platform with a 128x64 OLED, haptic feedback, and a customizable UI, ready to be hacked for countless applications.
